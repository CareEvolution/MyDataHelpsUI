        "Summary": "\n<h2>What are rapid tests?</h2>\n<p>Rapid tests, also known as rapid diagnostic tests or RDTs, are easy-to-use tests that provide quick results, usually in 20 minutes or less. Unlike most standard tests, which have to be sent to a lab, rapid tests are done and provide results at the point of care. The point of care is the place where you are getting care. It can include your provider's office, a clinic, or even your own home.</p>\n<p>Rapids tests usually include the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will provide a sample of your body fluid, such as <a data-tid=\"6037\" href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/blood.html\">blood</a>, urine, saliva, or nasal secretions.</li>\n<li>The sample is mixed with a special substance that will cause a chemical reaction if a disease or other condition is present.</li>\n<li>Results will show on a dipstick or rapid test cassette.\n<ul>\n<li>A dipstick is a thin, plastic strip that's coated with chemicals. If the test is positive, the dipstick will change colors when placed in the sample.</li>\n<li>A rapid test cassette is a small, plastic case that has a well that holds the sample. The well will show a letter or a symbol to indicate the result.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most rapid tests are highly accurate, but the results are not always as accurate as standard lab tests. </p>\n<p>Other names: rapid diagnostic tests, RDT's point-of-care tests</p><h2>How are they used?</h2>\n<p>Rapid tests are most often used to diagnose <a data-tid=\"513\" href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/infectiousdiseases.html\">infectious diseases</a>, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a data-tid=\"299\" href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/flu.html\">Flu</a></li>\n<li><a data-tid=\"421\" href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/streptococcalinfections.html\">Strep throat</a></li>\n<li><a data-tid=\"315\" href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/malaria.html\">Malaria</a></li>\n<li><a data-tid=\"1\" href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/hivaids.html\">HIV</a></li>\n<li><a data-tid=\"3181\" href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/covid19coronavirusdisease2019.html\">COVID 19</a>. <a data-tid=\"7627\" href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/covid19testing.html\">Rapid tests for COVID-19</a> usually provide results in about 30 minutes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rapid tests are also used in certain <a data-pid=\"31381\" href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/at-home-medical-tests/\">home-based tests</a>, such as pregnancy tests.</p><h2>What are the advantages and disadvantages of rapid tests?</h2>\n<p>The advantages of rapid tests include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fast results.</strong> This may allow you to get treatment faster. Faster treatment can reduce the severity of your symptoms, and may help prevent the spread of disease</li>\n<li><strong>Easy to use.</strong> They can be done by non-medical workers and volunteers who have been trained to do the test.  You may even be able to perform a rapid test on yourself.</li>\n<li><strong>Little or no special equipment required.</strong> This is especially useful in areas with limited resources or access to specialized labs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Disadvantages of rapid tests:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lower sensitivity than lab tests.</strong> Sensitivity means how well a test can identify a disease or condition. Rapid tests are not as good as lab tests at finding diseases in the earliest stages of infection.</li>\n<li><strong>False negatives are more common.</strong> A false negative result means your test shows you don't have a disease or condition, but you actually do have it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Providers will often take a second sample and send it to a lab for testing to confirm or rule out the results of a rapid test. But you may be able to get treatment and help prevent the spread of disease while you wait for lab results.</p><h2>Is there anything else I need to know about rapid tests?</h2>\n<p>Home based rapid tests are available for COVID-19. Like other rapid tests, the rapid COVID-19 tests have lower sensitivity than standard lab tests. But getting fast, home-based results may help prevent the spread of disease. Talk to your health care provider to learn more about these home-based tests.</p><h2>References</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].
